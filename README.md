Three "Malware" Assignment

This repository contains an Android Studio app project which is a simple Android application. I used the emulator set to a Pixel 2 running API 24. 

This app is meant to be a Trojan Horse masquerading as a popular mobile game with a casual competitive aspect. This will entice the user to enter in their login credentials to popular social networking sites believing it to be the secure login something like Firebase commonly provides in similar apps.

This Trojan Horse follows the model of performing the malicious function that completely replaces the function of the original program because I felt it was a bit beyond the scope of this assignment to make an actual game, but this would work much better if it actual had a game that users could play and invite their friends to play and then perform the malicious action sometime in the future after getting more users to enter their information. 

The malicious function of the Trojan Horse is it has a simple keylogger that logs the login credentials the user enters and stores them. The app then spams the user's email address with messages directing the victim to download a file from the internet and run it to receive information on how to recover their compromised data. This file is actually just a simple fork bomb.
